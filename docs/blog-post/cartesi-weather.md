# Introducing Cartesi-Weather: A Secure and Auditable Weather Forecasting System for Informed Agriculture Investment
In the agriculture futures market, weather conditions can make or break crop productivity, significantly impacting investment decisions. To help market participants make more informed choices, we're proud to introduce Cartesi-Weather, a pioneering project that combines the power of PyTorch and Cartesi Machine to provide accurate and secure weather forecasts.

By leveraging a first of its kind custom Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model inside a Cartesi Virtual Machine (CVM), we've created a highly secure and auditable system that protects sensitive user data while delivering reliable weather predictions. 

This innovative solution enables agriculture futures market participants to better anticipate weather-related risks and opportunities, making more informed investment decisions.

What sets Cartesi-Weather apart is its ability to outsource computationally expensive weather forecast computations without relying on trusted third-party service providers.

By running PyTorch models inside the Cartesi Machine, investors can tap into scalable and secure infrastructure without shouldering the burden of expensive hardware or relying on untrusted intermediaries. This decentralized approach ensures that sensitive data remains private and secure, while still providing access to accurate and timely weather forecasts.

Furthermore, Cartesi-Weather provides a general framework for running inference on any PyTorch model within the Cartesi Machine, offering a versatile foundation for a wide range of applications. Developers can easily swap models and adjust client inputs, unlocking new possibilities for secure and private AI-driven insights.
